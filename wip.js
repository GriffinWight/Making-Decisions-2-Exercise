// Switch statements can be excellent alternatives to if blocks. Look up switch statements (I recommend W3 Schools) and try to implement one for the following.

// Do not edit the code below.
let letterGrade = 'B'
// Do not edit the code above.

/* Use a switch statement on 'letterGrade' and console.log the appropriate response.

If A: "The student is doing excellently."
If B: "The student is doing well."
If C: "The student is doing alright."
If D: "The student is not doing very well."
If F: "The student is failing."
If the letter grade is not one of the above letters, console.log 'Not an eligible grade.'
